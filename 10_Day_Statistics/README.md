My C++ implementation on HackerRank session 10 -Day Statistics (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics). Day2 and Day3 questions were formulated as multiple choice, so the answer is given through a brief explanation on a .txt file. Implemented it on Visual Studio, so the "stdafx.cpp", "stdafx.h",
"targetvar.h" files are included.
